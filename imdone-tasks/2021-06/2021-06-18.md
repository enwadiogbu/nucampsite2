# [Task 2](#DONE:-10)
<card>

There are two types of components in React: class components and functional components.
This is an example of a class component. It begins with the class keyword, followed by a capitalized component name that should be unique within your entire app. 
Then, you use the JavaScript class inheritance keyword extends, followed by Component, which is the parent class provided by the React library from which you are creating this child class. 
Inside the class component body, a constructor method is required in two cases: When you are storing local state inside this component, and when you wish to bind methods -- this will be explained more fully later. For now, simply recognize that a constructor is sometimes required, but not always.
When a constructor is used, then it must take props as an argument. Props is short for properties and is an important keyword and concept in React. 
The first line of the constructor must be super(props); so that the props are communicated to the base constructor in the parent component.
Then, if using state, this.state must be set equal to an object. It is currently an empty object. We will fill it in next.
Add the campsites data to the state object in the Directory component's constructor, as shown below:
. . .
        this.state = {
            campsites: [
                {
                    id: 0,
                    name: 'React Lake Campground',
                    image: 'assets/images/react-lake.jpg',
                    elevation: 1233,
                    description: "Nestled in the foothills of the Chrome Mountains, this campground on the shores of the pristine React Lake is a favorite for fly fishers."
                },
                {
                  id: 1,
                  name: 'Chrome River Campground ',
                  image: 'assets/images/chrome-river.jpg',
                  elevation: 877,
                  description: "Spend a few sunny days and starry nights beneath a canopy of old-growth firs at this enchanting spot by the Chrome River."
                },
                {
                    id: 2,
                    name: 'Breadcrumb Trail Campground',
                    image: 'assets/images/breadcrumb-trail.jpg',
                    elevation: 2901,
                    description: "Let NuCamp be your guide to this off-the-beaten-path, hike-in-only campground."
                },
                {
                    id: 3,
                    name: 'Redux Woods Campground',
                    image: 'assets/images/redux-woods.jpg',
                    elevation: 42,
                    description: "You'll never want to leave this hidden gem, deep within the lush Redux Woods."
                }
            ],
        };
. . .

# [Task 3](#DONE:-20)

Add a Directory Component 
Go to the public folder inside your React project folder (3-React/nucampsite/public). 
Create a new folder there named assets.
Download the images.zip file provided above, then unzip the file inside the assets folder, so that you end up with a folder named images there.
Go to the src folder inside your React project folder (3-React/nucampsite/src).
Create a new folder there named components. 
In VS Code, create a new file in the components folder and name it DirectoryComponent.js.
Add the following code to DirectoryComponent.js: 
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Directory extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {};
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div />
        );
    }
}

export default Directory;
There are two types of components in React: class components and functional components.
This is an example of a class component. It begins with the class keyword, followed by a capitalized component name that should be unique within your entire app. 
Then, you use the JavaScript class inheritance keyword extends, followed by Component, which is the parent class provided by the React library from which you are creating this child class.

When a constructor is used, then it must take props as an argument. Props is short for properties and is an important keyword and concept in React. 
The first line of the constructor must be super(props); so that the props are communicated to the base constructor in the parent component.
Then, if using state, this.state must be set equal to an object. It is currently an empty object. We will fill it in next.
Add the campsites data to the state object in the Directory component's constructor, as shown below:
. . .
        this.state = {
            campsites: [
                {
                    id: 0,
                    name: 'React Lake Campground',
                    image: 'assets/images/react-lake.jpg',
                    elevation: 1233,
                    description: "Nestled in the foothills of the Chrome Mountains, this campground on the shores of the pristine React Lake is a favorite for fly fishers."
                },
                {
                  id: 1,
                  name: 'Chrome River Campground ',
                  image: 'assets/images/chrome-river.jpg',
                  elevation: 877,
                  description: "Spend a few sunny days and starry nights beneath a canopy of old-growth firs at this enchanting spot by the Chrome River."
                },
                {
                    id: 2,
                    name: 'Breadcrumb Trail Campground',
                    image: 'assets/images/breadcrumb-trail.jpg',
                    elevation: 2901,
                    description: "Let NuCamp be your guide to this off-the-beaten-path, hike-in-only campground."
                },
                {
                    id: 3,
                    name: 'Redux Woods Campground',
                    image: 'assets/images/redux-woods.jpg',
                    elevation: 42,
                    description: "You'll never want to leave this hidden gem, deep within the lush Redux Woods."
                }
            ],
        };
. . .
Next, still in DirectoryComponent.js, fill in the render() method of the Directory component as follows. This will pull the data for each campsite, using map, from the array you just added to the state. Then it will go through each to format its name and description and render them all. 
. . .
    render() {
        const directory = this.state.campsites.map(campsite => {
            return (
                <div className="col">
                    <img src={campsite.image} alt={campsite.name} />
                    <h2>{campsite.name}</h2>
                    <p>{campsite.description}</p>
                </div>
            );
        });

        return (
            <div className="container">
                <div className="row">
                    {directory}
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
. . .
Next, open App.js and update it as follows: 
. . .
import Directory from './components/DirectoryComponent';
. . .
            </Navbar>
            <Directory />
. . .
Save all changes. 
Test your app in the browser now by running it with yarn start. You should be able to see the campsites' images and names displayed. 
However, there's one more thing you need to do with the Directory component. Open your developer console on the browser tab with the nucampsite React app in it, and you will notice an error message saying that each child in a list needs a unique key prop. 
The word 'list' here does not refer to HTML lists created with the <ol> <ul> and <li> elements specifically, though it can also apply to HTML lists. This refers to lists generated in React through rendering an array, as we have done through the directory array above. When you give React an array of elements to render, it's smart and knows how to display them as a list, but it needs a little help from you to make the code efficient: a unique key for each of the items in the list.
We will use the campsite id for that key. The key must be on the top level element of each array item, which in this case is a <div> element. Modify this <div> in the Directory component's definition in the DirectoryComponent.js file, as you see below:
. . .
    render() {
        const directory = this.state.campsites.map(campsite => {
            return (
                <div key={campsite.id} className="col">
. . .
Now if you test your app, the error message in the console should be gone.
Optional: Do a Git commit with the message "Components Part 1". 

Summary
In this exercise, we added a new component to our React application, added data to its class, and then updated the app to show the information in the web page. You learned to render arrays as lists, and how to add a unique key to each list item.

campsites.js


Update the Directory Component 
Open DirectoryComponent.js  and update its contents as follows. Note that we have removed the campsites variable from the state of the component, and updated it to use the Card: 
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Card, CardImg, CardImgOverlay, CardText, CardBody, CardTitle } from 'reactstrap';

class Directory extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            selectedCampsite: null
        };
    }

    onCampsiteSelect(campsite) {
        this.setState({selectedCampsite: campsite});
    }

    renderSelectedCampsite(campsite) {
        if (campsite) {
            return (
                <Card>
                    <CardImg top src={campsite.image} alt={campsite.name} />
                    <CardBody>
                        <CardTitle>{campsite.name}</CardTitle>
                        <CardText>{campsite.description}</CardText>
                    </CardBody>
                </Card>
            );
        }
        return <div />;
    }

    render() {
        const directory = this.props.campsites.map(campsite => {
            return (
                <div key={campsite.id} className="col-md-5 m-1">
                    <Card onClick={() => this.onCampsiteSelect(campsite)}>
                        <CardImg width="100%" src={campsite.image} alt={campsite.name} />
                        <CardImgOverlay>
                            <CardTitle>{campsite.name}</CardTitle>
                        </CardImgOverlay>
                    </Card>
                </div>
            );
        });

        return (
            <div className="container">
                <div className="row">
                    {directory}
                </div>
                <div className="row">
                    <div className="col-md-5 m-1">
                        {this.renderSelectedCampsite(this.state.selectedCampsite)}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Directory;

Move state to App.js
Add a folder named shared inside the src folder. 
In the shared folder, download the campsites.js file given at the top of this page under the heading Exercise Resources, and move it to the shared folder.
Open App.js and update it as follows:  
. . .
import { CAMPSITES } from './shared/campsites';
. . .
class App extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            campsites: CAMPSITES
        };
    }
. . .
                <Directory campsites={this.state.campsites} />
. . .


Add fonts and styles
In your bash terminal, inside the nucampsite project folder for React, install the Open Sans and Lobster fonts using Yarn:
yarn add typeface-lobster
yarn add typeface-open-sans
Open index.js and import the typefaces. Make sure that the import for App is positioned as the last one in the list of imports:
. . .
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import 'typeface-lobster';
import 'typeface-open-sans';
import App from './App';
. . .
Open App.css and delete all its contents. Replace it with the following content:
body {
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}

.card-title {
    font: 500 1.25rem "Lobster", cursive;
}

.card-img-overlay .card-title {
    color: white;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
Save and test all the changes. If you had the server open previously, you may need to stop and restart the server to see the changes.
Optional: Do a Git commit with the message "Components Part 2". 

Summary

In this lesson, you learned to lift the state from one component (Directory) to its parent component (App), then passed the state information down as props, changing references from state to props as appropriate. 
You also extracted the campsites into its own separate module and import it into App.js.
In DirectoryComponent.js, you also learned to set up Reactstrap Card components to display the campsites data, and added functionality to display more information about a particular campsite when a user clicks on it.

# [CodePen: JSX and State](#DONE:-40)
<card>

Code Challenge
In line 13, between the div tags, add a JSX span element (with both open and close tags). Embed the property "bootcamp" stored in the state of this component inside the span element's open and close tags.
Add another JSX span element, and embed the variable "course" inside this one.
In the CSS section, there are two classes: .blue-box and .orange-box. Apply the .blue-box class to the first JSX span element, and the .orange-box class to the second.
